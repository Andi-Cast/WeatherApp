# **Weather App**
### This React app utilizes multiple APIs to provide current weather conditions and forecast for selected cities.
-----
## **Application Details**
- For this app, I aimed to create a user-friendly weather application that allows users to search for cities and get real-time weather information. The app provides current weather conditions, a 7-day forecast, and the ability to save favorite cities for quick access.
- Users can search for cities, view current weather and forecast details, and save or remove cities from their favorites.
- The background image of the app changes dynamically based on the current weather condition of the selected city, providing a visually engaging experience.

## **Technology Used**
- Visual Studio Code
- React
- OpenWeatherMap API fo weather data
- GeoDB for city search
